Task for Trainees: Build a Dynamic To-Do List Application

Objective Create a simple To-Do list application using JavaScript and DOM manipulation techniques. The application should allow users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed

Requirements:

1. HTML Structura

Create a basic HTML structure with the following elements:

An input field where users can type their tasks. A button labeled "Add Task" that adds the task to the list. An unordered list (ul) where tasks will be displayed.

2. Java Script Functionality:
Add Task
When the "Add Task" button is clicked, the task typed in the input field should be added to the ul as a new li element.



If the input field is empty, show an alert saying "Please enter a task"



After adding the task, clear the input field 

Delete Task 
Each task should have a "Delete" button next to it.. When the "Delete" button is clicked, the task should be removed from the

list




Mark Task as Completed.

When a task is clicked, it should be marked as completed (use CSS to strike through the text or change the background color)

clicking on the task again should unmark it as completed.

3 .Css Styling
Style the application to make it visually appealing

Use CSS classes to handle the completed tasks (eg, strikethrough effect or change of text color).

Bonus Features (Optional):

Edit Tesk

Allow users to edit a task after it has been added.

Persist Tasks

Save the tasks in the browser's local storage so that they persist even after the

page is refreshed.

Add buttons to filter tasks by "All", "Completed", and "Incomplete
